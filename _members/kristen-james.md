Kristen James (she/her) is a PhD candidate studying [Nutritional Biology](https://ggnb.ucdavis.edu) with an emphasis in Genetics at the University of California, Davis. Kristen is inspired by the broad question, "what makes you, you and me, me?". To address this, Kristen uses translational approaches in healthy adults and outbred mice to characterize the roles of diet, the gut microbiome, and genetics in the regulation of the plasma metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), which is associated with cardiovascular disease. 

After completing her PhD, she is excited to expand her nutrigenomic and bioinformatic skills during her postdoctoral fellowship under the supervision of Dr. Joanne Cole in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus. Long-term, James' scientific goals include leading a research group that promotes precision health through data-informed nutrition, exercise, and pharmaceutical strategies. 

Kristen enjoys making art ("art-stagram", @kjsketch), most forms of exercising (skiing, hiking, running, swimming, cycling, playing tennis, golfing, lifting, and doing yoga), and spending time with friends and family.
